Submitted by: **Tarina Muna**

This web app: **Samosa Selector is a fun incremental clicker game. Players click on a giant samosa to earn samosas, and unlock powerful upgrades to multiply their click value. The goal? Collect as many samosas as possible!**

Time spent: **1 hr 34 min** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:



  - [x] A large samosa that the user can click to harvest one samosa at a time
  - [x] A counter displaying the number of samosas the user currently has
  - [x] Three upgrades that increase the effectiveness of the userâ€™s cursor at certain point thresholds
  

The following **optional** features are implemented:
